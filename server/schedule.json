    "description": "In this talk we will present how at Bell-Labs (Alcatel-Lucent R&amp;D division) we benefit from using Docker in combination with the SDN solution from Nuage Networks for development and deployment of a next-gen chat-based communication platform. This communication platform does intensive data analytics, runs a number of multi-media services and can control remote appliances (e.g. thermostats, robots, cameras, etc). We will illustrate the stringent telco requirements to successfully operate such a communication platform, including some non-functional needs like high-availability, reliability, elasticity, QoS and lifecycle management. Furthermore, we will explain why we selected docker as a hosting platform and how we have utilized it. We will also share some of the deployment scenarios we are facing and how these are addressed by combining Docker and Nuage VSP. Lastly, we will share the lessons we have learned during this development process, and propose some improvements\/extensions for Docker to evolve into an application stack that is able to meet the stringent needs of telco applications.&nbsp;",

Are infrastructure resources being allocated correctly based on business need? These are exactly the kind of questions that organizations must be able to answer but, surprisingly, they struggle with these questions. Called The Salamander, the tool has provided the bank an unparalleled ability to optimise and simplify business IT processes, which ultimately saves costs and leads to an improved customer experience. The Salamander team designed a solution running on a cloud computing architecture with several NoSQL solutions as Neo4J, MongoDB, REDIS,.... With these repositories they generate data visualisations that clearly demonstrate the relationship between among operations. The front-end and back-end of the application communicate via RESTFUL APIs and NodeJS-based servers provide elasticity when accessing the stored data. The new challenges are related with the need of load and use specific result sets stored and useful to diagnosis but not for immediate reading. At this point appears Docker appears as a solution to offer fast and easy custom database service.&nbsp;<\/p>",

When a computation is finished, resources are automatically freed and available for other uses, since all processes are run in Docker containers.&nbsp;\r\n<p>In this talk we are going to present why Zoe, the Container Analytics as a Service, was born, its architecture and the problems it tries to solve. Zoe would not be there without Swarm and Docker and we will also talk about some of the stumbling blocks we encountered and the solutions we found, in particular in transparently connecting Docker hosts through a physical network. Zoe was born as a research prototype, but is now stable and is currently being used to run real jobs from users in our research institution.

The volunteer computers themselves come from interested users all over the world who download and run the software allowing them to become volunteers (called BOINC). The system is working exceedingly well and using Docker has made it massively easier for us to develop and run it. I will explain some of the technical details of the implementation, which involves a customized boot2docker ISO, as well give a brief summary of the scientific questions we are trying to answer and how these results made possible by Docker are helping analyze data from, e.g. the European Space Agency's Planck satellite.&nbsp;<br \/>",

This includes from how to help your users become your contributors, to how to install tools in your machine without really installing anything, or how containers can be the killer tool for the polyglot programmer.&nbsp;<\/em>\r\n<p><em>The goal is to give an overview of the techniques that power these use cases and to inspire the audience to improve their communities by leveraging the power of Docker.&nbsp;<br \/><br \/><\/em><strong>2. Breaking the RPiDocker Challenge by Nicolas de Loof, Yoann Dubreuil, Damien Duportal<br \/><br \/><\/strong>Docker claim to be a lightweight virtualization solution, and indeed it so light you can play on tiny hardware like Raspberry Pi and run Hundred containers. Hypriot demonstrated running 500 of them, but can we do more ? The RPiDocker challenge was proposed to get the community study some more hacks to get more and more containers running on the Pi. During this session we will explain how we went into this effort, and eventually where able to run 2740 web servers ... on a RapsberryPi.&nbsp;<br \/><br \/><strong>3. Docker on IoT devices by Shaun Mulligan<\/strong><br \/><br \/>The Resin.io team has brought Docker to IoT in a big way. Shaun will walk through the ways in which his team has enabled&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/resin.io\/\" target=\"_blank\">resin.io<\/a>'s container-powered edge device management platform to work with all sorts of linux-based devices. These include the Raspberry Pi, Beaglebone, Intel Edison, NUC, Hummingboard and countless custom boards. This talk will include an overview of the toolchain (Docker, Yocto, meta-resin), the approach, the customer use cases, and how you can get involved.&nbsp;<\/p>",
